### Algorithm Analysis:

#### Definition of Algorithm:

An algorithm is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order, to accomplish a certain predefined task. It represents the core logic or solution of a problem and can be expressed either as an informal high-level description in pseudocode or using a flowchart. Every algorithm must satisfy the following criteria:

1. **Input:**
   - An algorithm has zero or more input quantities externally supplied, taken from a set of objects called the domain of the algorithm.

2. **Output:**
   - It has one or more output quantities that generate a set called the range of the algorithm.

3. **Definiteness:**
   - Each instruction must be clear and unambiguous, meaning each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined.

4. **Finiteness:**
   - If we trace out the instructions of an algorithm, then for all cases, the algorithm will terminate after a finite number of steps.

5. **Correctness or Effectiveness:**
   - Every instruction must be sufficiently basic that it can, in principle, be carried out by a person manually and must generate a correct output.

#### Analysis of Algorithms:

The effectiveness of an algorithm is reflected in its performance, with program performance referring to the program as a whole, and efficiency to a part of the program. Efficiency is characterized by the algorithm's execution time and memory space consumption.

1. **Space Complexity:**
   - Refers to the amount of memory space required by the algorithm during its execution.
   - Components include:
     - Instruction Space: Space for storing the executable version of the program.
     - Data Space: Space for constants, variables, and temporary variables.
     - Environment Space: Space for environment information needed to resume suspended functions.
   - Space complexity is critical for multi-user systems and situations with limited memory.

2. **Time Complexity:**
   - Represents the amount of time required by the program to run until completion.
   - It is affected by the complexity of instructions, including machine execution time, time to execute the instruction, the instruction set, and translation.
   - Influenced by physical hardware and software tools used for program translation.

#### Space Complexity of Algorithms:

When evaluating space complexity, it's essential to consider the memory used by the algorithm, including input values. Auxiliary Space, the extra or temporary space used during execution, contributes to space complexity.

- **Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input Space**

During execution, algorithms use memory for instruction space, environmental stack, and data space. However, when calculating space complexity, the focus is typically on data space, excluding instruction space and the environmental stack, which are hardware-dependent.

### Asymptotic Notations:

In algorithm analysis, asymptotic notations are used to describe the growth rate of algorithms' time or space complexity as the input size approaches infinity. Three commonly used asymptotic notations are Omega (Ω), Theta (Θ), and Big O (O).

#### 1. **Big O Notation (O):**
- **Definition:**
  - Represents the upper bound or worst-case scenario of an algorithm's time or space complexity.
  - Denoted as O(f(n)), where "f(n)" is a mathematical function representing the growth rate.
- **Example:**
  - If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it means the algorithm's running time will not exceed a quadratic function of the input size.

#### 2. **Omega Notation (Ω):**
- **Definition:**
  - Represents the lower bound or best-case scenario of an algorithm's time or space complexity.
  - Denoted as Ω(f(n)), where "f(n)" is a mathematical function.
- **Example:**
  - If an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n), it means the algorithm's running time will be at least linear in terms of the input size.

#### 3. **Theta Notation (Θ):**
- **Definition:**
  - Represents both upper and lower bounds, providing a tight bound on an algorithm's time or space complexity.
  - Denoted as Θ(f(n)), where "f(n)" is a mathematical function.
- **Example:**
  - If an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(n), it means the algorithm's running time is linear, and both best-case and worst-case scenarios are linear.

### Relationship Between Notations:

- **Big O (O):**
  - Provides an upper limit.
  - It characterizes the worst-case performance of an algorithm.

- **Omega (Ω):**
  - Provides a lower limit.
  - It characterizes the best-case performance of an algorithm.

- **Theta (Θ):**
  - Provides both upper and lower limits.
  - It characterizes the average-case performance of an algorithm.

### Summary:

- **O(f(n)):**
  - Upper bound, worst-case scenario.
  - Represents the maximum growth rate.

- **Ω(f(n)):**
  - Lower bound, best-case scenario.
  - Represents the minimum growth rate.

- **Θ(f(n)):**
  - Tight bound, both upper and lower limits.
  - Represents a balanced view of the algorithm's performance.
